# BLE Penetration Testing Configuration - Safety First
#
# This configuration emphasizes safety, authorization, and audit controls.
# Use this template when conducting authorized security assessments.
#
# Usage: python -m ble_pentest pairing --config config_safety_first.yaml

# Global settings with safety emphasis
global:
  # Enable verbose output for full audit trail
  verbose: true
  
  # Reasonable discovery timeout
  discovery_timeout: 10
  
  # Mandatory audit logging to file
  log_file: "ble_pentest_audit.log"
  
  # Enable debug logging for investigation
  debug: false

# Target a specific authorized device
target:
  # Replace with actual device MAC address
  # Example format: "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"
  address: "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"

# Conservative attack parameters
attack:
  # Start with pairing analysis (less intrusive than fuzzing)
  type: "pairing"
  
  # Reasonable timeout to avoid hanging
  timeout: 20
  
  # Retry with conservative limits
  retry_on_failure: true
  max_retries: 2
  retry_delay: 3

# Detailed reporting with recommendations
reporting:
  # Human-readable format
  format: "html"
  
  # Include recommendations for remediation
  include_recommendations: true
  
  # Include technical analysis for understanding
  include_analysis: true
  
  # Name report with timestamp for organization
  output_file: "ble_assessment_report.html"
  
  # Include captures for investigation
  include_captures: true

# STRICT AUTHORIZATION CONTROLS
# Testing is limited to explicitly authorized devices
scope:
  # Only test this specific device
  authorized_addresses:
    - "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"
  
  # Optional: Also match specific device names for double-check
  authorized_names:
    - "AuthorizedDevice"
  
  # Require explicit approval before each attack
  require_approval: true

# Conservative advanced settings
advanced:
  # Do not keep connections open between tests
  persistent_connection: false
  
  # Test devices sequentially (safer)
  parallel_processing: false
  
  # Standard timing, no jitter (predictable behavior)
  timing_jitter: 0
  
  # Use platform-specific safeguards
  platform_optimizations: true

# IMPORTANT REMINDERS:
# 
# 1. Replace "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF" with your target device's actual MAC address
# 2. Replace "AuthorizedDevice" with the target device's name
# 3. Ensure you have written authorization to test this device
# 4. Keep the audit log file (ble_pentest_audit.log) for accountability
# 5. Review the generated report before taking any action
# 6. Store all reports and logs for documentation and audit purposes
#
# AUTHORIZATION CHECKLIST:
# 
# [ ] Written authorization obtained from device owner
# [ ] Device MAC address verified
# [ ] Device name verified
# [ ] Testing scope and timeframe documented
# [ ] Approval authority informed
# [ ] Safe testing environment prepared
# [ ] Backup/recovery procedures in place
# [ ] Audit logging enabled
# [ ] Results review scheduled

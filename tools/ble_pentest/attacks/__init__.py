"""Attack implementations for the BLE pentest harness.

The attacks in this package are *optional* and rely on third-party BLE tooling
(such as ``bleak``). They are imported dynamically through the harness
configuration's ``attack_modules`` list.

Each attack inherits :class:`tools.ble_pentest.base.BleAttackTest`.
